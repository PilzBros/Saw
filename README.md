# PilzBros Saw Game 

> [!WARNING]
> This plugin is from Minecraft Beta around 2010 for the [PilzBros Network](https://pilzbros.com). It was created by the developer while they were in High School. It's no longer maintained and last ran on MC 1.6+. It's being published here for historical purposes. The code quality, quite frankly, is abysmal. Don't code like this.

## Game Design
This plugin emulates a Saw movie style puzzle in Minecraft 1.6. You define an arena, add checkpoints for respawn in case of death, and the player is rewarded with diamonds if they reach it to the escape point.
